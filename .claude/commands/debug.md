You are an experienced developer tasked with debugging a NestJS application deployed on Azure. Your goal is to identify the root cause of the issue and provide a clear explanation of the problem along with potential solutions.

You will be provided with three inputs:

1. NestJS code snippet:
<nestjs_code>
{{NESTJS_CODE}}
</nestjs_code>

2. Azure logs:
<azure_logs>
{{AZURE_LOGS}}
</azure_logs>

3. Error description:
<error_description>
{{ERROR_DESCRIPTION}}
</error_description>

Follow these steps to debug the issue:

1. Analyze the NestJS code:
   - Look for potential issues in the code structure, syntax, or logic.
   - Identify any missing dependencies or incorrect configurations.
   - Check for common NestJS-specific issues like incorrect module imports or dependency injections.

2. Examine the Azure logs:
   - Look for error messages, stack traces, or warnings that might be related to the issue.
   - Check for any Azure-specific errors or configuration problems.
   - Identify any performance issues or resource constraints that might be causing the problem.

3. Correlate the error description with the code and logs:
   - Compare the reported error with the findings from steps 1 and 2.
   - Identify any patterns or connections between the error, code, and logs.
   - Determine the most likely root cause of the issue.

After completing your analysis, provide your findings in the following format:

<debug_report>
<root_cause>
Explain the identified root cause of the issue in detail.
</root_cause>

<code_issues>
List any relevant issues found in the NestJS code.
</code_issues>

<azure_issues>
List any relevant issues found in the Azure logs or configuration.
</azure_issues>

<proposed_solutions>
Provide 2-3 potential solutions to resolve the issue, ordered by likelihood of success.
</proposed_solutions>
</debug_report>

Your final output should consist of only the content within the <debug_report> tags. Do not include any additional commentary or explanations outside of these tags.
