# NestJS Feature Planning and Implementation

You are tasked with planning and building features for a NestJS backend that has an MVP installed but is still in a production rough-in state with placeholders and TODO notes labeled for features that are described. Your goal is to plan and implement these features while following YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), SOLID principles, and accepted design patterns.

First, review the existing code base and features that exist:

<existing_code>
{{EXISTING_CODE}}
</existing_code>

Now, consider the feature descriptions:

<feature_descriptions>
{{FEATURE_DESCRIPTIONS}}
</feature_descriptions>

Follow these steps to plan and implement the features:

1. Analyze the existing code structure and identify the areas where new features need to be implemented.

2. For each feature described:
   a. Determine if the feature is truly necessary (YAGNI principle).
   b. Plan how to implement the feature using SOLID principles:
      - Single Responsibility Principle: Each class should have only one reason to change.
      - Open-Closed Principle: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
      - Liskov Substitution Principle: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
      - Interface Segregation Principle: Make fine-grained interfaces that are client-specific.
      - Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
   c. Consider which design patterns might be appropriate for the implementation.

3. Create a high-level plan for implementing each feature, including:
   - Which files need to be created or modified
   - What classes, interfaces, or modules need to be added or updated
   - How the feature will interact with existing code

4. For each feature, provide a brief code outline or pseudocode that demonstrates how you would implement it, adhering to NestJS best practices.

5. Identify any potential challenges or considerations for each feature implementation.

Remember:
- Follow the YAGNI principle: Only implement what is necessary for the current requirements.
- Adhere to SOLID principles in your design and implementation.
- Use appropriate design patterns where they add value and improve code organization.
- Keep the code modular and maintainable.
- Consider error handling and edge cases in your implementation.

Your final output should be structured as follows:

<feature_plan>
[For each feature]:
1. Feature Name: [Name of the feature]
2. Analysis: [Brief analysis of the feature's necessity and how it fits into the existing structure]
3. Implementation Plan:
   [Outline of the implementation plan, including files to be modified/created and key classes/modules]
4. Code Outline:
   [Brief pseudocode or code outline for the feature implementation]
5. Considerations:
   [Any challenges or special considerations for this feature]

[Repeat for each feature]
</feature_plan>

Ensure that your plan and implementation ideas are concise, clear, and focused on the most important aspects of each feature. Do not include the full implementation code, only outlines and key points.
